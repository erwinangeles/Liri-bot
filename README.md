# Liri-bot

LIRI is a lot like SIRI except not speech recognition or on a phone but rather commands from the command line that does 3 maybe 4 things. So maybe its not like SIRI. It can search spotify for song information, IMDB for movie information, Bandsintown for concert information, or read a txt file for search type and search information.

This app utilizes Spotify, OMDB, and Bandsintown API's.
